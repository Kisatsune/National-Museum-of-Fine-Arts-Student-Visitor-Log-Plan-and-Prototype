Project Title: Museum Student Visitor Log and Data Repository

The Problem: The museum currently suffers from insufficient data collection for
tracking and analyzing student visitor engagement. It's difficult to efficiently measure
which schools participate most or which programs are the most popular. 

The Goal: To transform raw attendance figures into strategic, actionable intelligence
for decision-making and resource allocation.
